* As a user, I want to be able to search and save books that i am interested in.

The user will be able to:

  * Search the name of a book, resulting with the title, poster image, author, and description.

  * Each book result will also have links for the google page store, save, and delete.

  * Saving the book will remove the book from the main page list and place it in the Saved page list where you can view them there and delete.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
